# hackerrank_practice-c
This repository contains my daily practice solutions for HackerRank problems.
I consistently solve problems across multiple topics and store each solution in a separate file for better organization, readability, and long-term revision.

The main goal of this repository is to:
1. Build strong problem-solving skills.
2. Improve coding consistency.
3. Maintain a well-structured record of practice.
